Tight Feedback Loop Exists

Lighthouse scores improve weekly

You fix bugs faster than you create them

Your components work consistently across browsers

You're Solving Real Problems

Your portfolio projects have actual users (even just 5 friends)

You can explain why you chose Flexbox over Grid for specific layouts

You notice accessibility issues on popular sites instinctively

JavaScript FOMO is Gone

You build complex layouts with pure CSS

You create interactive components (modals, tabs) with HTML/CSS only

You understand CSS performance implications (reflows vs repaints)

Your Work Gets Harder, Not Easier

You're wrestling with container queries instead of basic media queries

You debug stacking context issues instead of basic positioning

You obsess over CLS metrics instead of just visual polish
